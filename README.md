## Who are you?

Some guy who likes C#, bash and HTML/CSS/JS. Recently I've been getting my hands dirty with C++ and Java.

I use Linux as my daily driver OS.

## Cool stuff

You can see some of the scripts I use in the [Bash-Scripts](https://github.com/GermanBread/Bash-Scripts) repo

Check out my other repos for interesting stuff. Or better yet, [visit my homepage!](https://germanbread.github.io/)
